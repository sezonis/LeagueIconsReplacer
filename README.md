# LeagueIconsReplacer

Automatically replaces all icons in the League of Legends atlas in Global.client.wad with your own. Syncs with CommunityDragon on the latest branch. Nothing required outside of the icons.

## Steps

   Item IDs can be found [here](https://darkintaqt.com/blog/item-ids)

2. Press Start Replacing

3. The WAD file is automatically generated.
